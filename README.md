## TO DO

- [x] Adapt *simplifiedSiwek* tutorial to gasifier mesh. 
- [ ] Have realistic flowrates and conditions.
- [ ] Remove file duplication, using existing file in $FOAM/{src,applications/solver}
- [ ] Switch from coal feed to something more close to VRO. 
- [ ] List features we need to implement so we can plan better.
- [ ] Eulerian to Lagrangian using OF tools; using *tutorials/multiphase/interFoam/laminar/vofToLagrangian* as template.

## Content

* Kaust development regarding gasification project.
* .bash_gas: aliases for paths. Add your own machines once sourcing of2212.

## Folders
* */run/simplifiedSiwek* from OF tutorial. Goal is to adapt tutorial to new mesh closer to Kaust gasifier.

## Notes

* Using OF2212
